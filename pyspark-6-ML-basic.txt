Correlation:
Calculating the correlation between two series of data is a common operation in Statistics. In spark.ml we provide the flexibility to calculate pairwise correlations among many series. The supported correlation methods are currently Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation.

Find full example code at "examples/src/main/python/ml/correlation_example.py" in the Spark repo.
>>>
import numpy as np
from pyspark import SparkContext
from pyspark.mllib.stat import Statistics
seriesX = sc.parallelize([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0])  # a series
seriesY = sc.parallelize([11.0, 22.0, 33.0, 33.0, 555.0])
print("Correlation is: " + str(Statistics.corr(seriesX, seriesY, method="pearson")))
data = sc.parallelize(
    [np.array([1.0, 10.0, 100.0]), np.array([2.0, 20.0, 200.0]), np.array([5.0, 33.0, 366.0])]
)
print(Statistics.corr(data, method="pearson"))

Hypothesis testing:
Hypothesis testing is a powerful tool in statistics to determine whether a result is statistically significant, whether this result occurred by chance or not. spark.ml currently supports Pearson’s Chi-squared ( χ2) tests for independence.

ChiSquareTest:
ChiSquareTest conducts Pearson’s independence test for every feature against the label. For each feature, the (feature, label) pairs are converted into a contingency matrix for which the Chi-squared statistic is computed. All label and feature values must be categorical.
